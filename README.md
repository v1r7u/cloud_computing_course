# Introduction to Cloud Computing

The repository accompanies Cloud Computing course and provides:

- instructions how to demo particular aspects of the Cloud;
- terraform templates to provision resources these demos when needed;
- homework descriptions.

At the moment, all the demo materials are focused on Azure Cloud as an example.

## Repository Structure

- `demo_steps_docs`: markdown formatted documents with step-by-step guides to perform demos;
- `files`: used images and diagrams;
- `homeworks`: homework description and grading;
- `src`: terraform configuration and source-code to provision required infrastructure.
