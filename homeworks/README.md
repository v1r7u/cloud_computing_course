# Homeworks

The course has several homeworks that gradually build a single project composed of several cloud services:
- Event Stream
- Object Store
- Database
- Function as a Service to glue everything together.

Additionally, we will evaluate project security, financial sustainability, observability, and test data restoration process.

## Homework requirements

- Each student maintains a private git repository with completed tasks (code, docs, images)
- Each task should be delivered as a Pull Request (PR). After course stuff has approved the PR, it could be merged into the main branch.
- You can pick **any cloud platform of your choice**

## List of tasks

To pass the course, you must get at least 60 points out from 100 possible.
