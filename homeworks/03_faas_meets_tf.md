# 3. (20 pt) Terraform configuration for the project

**The goal**: Terraform the project.

The project consist of several cloud components that have to be configured to play nicely together. Describe in terraform configuration of all the used cloud components: FaaS, Object Store, Event Stream, and their supplementary resources if needed.

This will be a ground work for future project enhancement, and collaboration:

- discussing the project details with peers;
- evolve the project to add new features;
- run automated tests and analysis.

### Deliveries

Reference to git repository with Terraform configuration and short instructions how to use it.

Tip: Sometimes not everything could be perfectly automated. It's ok to have several steps that has to be executed in stages with manual intervention in-between, as long as there are clear instructions how to do that.
